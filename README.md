# 🌐 Civora Nexus – Website Feedback Collector with Admin Dashboard

> 🚀 **This project is Part 1 of the Full Stack Web Development Internship under SECT Summer Internship Program 1.0 — 2025 and Civora Nexus.**

The **Website Feedback Collector with Admin Dashboard** is a full-stack web application built using **Flask**, **Vanilla JavaScript**, and **SQLite**. It allows website users to submit feedback, which is stored in a database and displayed in real-time on an admin dashboard. The project includes basic sentiment tagging based on keyword analysis and is deployed live using Render.

This application demonstrates core backend skills, dynamic templating, and client-server communication — and marks the beginning of my full stack internship journey.
